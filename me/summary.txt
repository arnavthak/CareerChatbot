My name is Arnav Thakrar. I'm an undergraduate student at UCONN studying Computer Science and an aspiring software engineer. 
I specialize in developing AI-powered applications and agents to solve business problems. I have experience doing so in the healthcare insurance domain.
I love all striking combat sports. I've been practicing Muay Thai for almost 2 years now, but along the way I've learned bits and pieces of boxing and Japanese K-1 style kickboxing.
